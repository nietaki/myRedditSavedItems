    <p>
        Reddit has a wealth of information and a lot of content worth going back to. You might be saving links and comments 
        to return to later, and they do accumulate over time. If you want to come back to that one particular thing in that 
        obscure subreddit, that you saw a year ago, you might be stuck going through pages and pages of your saved items on Reddit, 
        with not much success.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This webapp is here to solve this problem in a quick and efficient way. You authorize it (for an hour) using Reddit OAuth, 
        the browser loads your saved items in the background and after a couple of seconds you can easily browse and search through them
